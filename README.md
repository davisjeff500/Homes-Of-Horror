<h2>Solution Method</h2>

Collaborative Web Application that searches for Horror Movie Filming Locations using html, css framework, javascript and server side api's as part of DU Bootcamp Collaborative project.  For development we employed Agile SDLC by employing daily standups, sprint planning, sprint reviews and development direction and scope retrospectives.  We employed githubs own Issues and mainly used the Home of Horror Kanban.  Technolgies employed were the selection of node.js for apm only and Tailwind CSS for front end development.  Backend scripts were written with the aid of DUBootcamp classroom code, google, chatgpt, stack overflow, MDN, online fetch api tutorials and api documentation.
